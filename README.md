## Description  

This project is a full stack React App focused on individual users making small commitments to incrementally improve how we interact with the environment. In addition to react, I used a Mongo database and mongoose and I used SASS, CSS, and some bootstrap components to style. The site is responsive and I used react hooks including react state to show the navigation and some errors differently based on changes of state.
